DashJS is a RESTless Evented JavaScript library and set of tools which leverages some of the best JavaScript "micro-frameworks" out there to provide a single-namespace set of APIs for easy creation of multi-user capable (real-time, if needed), model-view web applications with templating. In other words, everything you need to build slick, modern, single-page web applications.

More info will be found here [soon]: http://dashjs.com

The micro-frameworks utilized for DashJS are:

	[backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)
	[underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/)
	[nowjs.js](http://nowjs.com/)
	[icanhaz.js](http://icanhazjs.com/)
